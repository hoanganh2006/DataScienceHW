# Final Project
Project Proposal

Project Title: Sign Language Recognition with Machine Learning
Team Members: Anjali Krishna Vengayil, Anh Huynh, Chander Viswanathan, Jeanette Ilongo
Project Description/Outline: We would like to build a machine that can read and interpret the sign language alphabet by looking at a personâ€™s hand.
Research Questions to Answer: How can we predict the static sign language gesture and how can we isolate the hand gesture and feed this image in the static gesture recognizer?
Data sources or Data Sets to be Used: https://medium.freecodecamp.org (example), Sci-Kit Learn, OpenCV, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Python Flask, Tabl
APIs to be consumed (if any) - None
Rough Breakdown of Tasks: Scrum Masters: Anh Data Engineers: Anjali Team Lead: Jeanette Testers: Chander
