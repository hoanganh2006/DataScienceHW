					<p>The US Census Bureau reports poverty rates by State that can be divided into very specific demographics. 
						In this visualization above, poverty status in the past 12 months of all families from the 2014 census, is presented across the bottom axis.	
					</p>
					<p>The CDC (Center for Disease Control) also conducts broad studies, collecting data from every state and territory on 
						health risk factors, such as, exercise behavior, smoking, drinking, reported ailments, and cognitive function. 
						The data represented in this visualization is the percentage of population with the highest education level being high school graduation or GED. 
					</p>
					<p>
						It is visually clear that the correlation is strong between educational achievment and possibility of poverty. 
						
					</p>
					<p>
						This article, from Center for Povery Research at UC Davis, highlights the importance of childhood and middle school education providing skills and a pipeline to secondary education. Strong arguments are made
						for community colleges and the unique role they can play to move individuals from historically underadvantaged families and communitites out of the poverty zone.
